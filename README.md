# hello-world
First repository practice

Dana here.  Just making comments to the README file on the main branch.

Now I have created my first branch, and I am testing it out. :smiley:

That *should* have rendered as an emoji.

Now I am making changes to test how this works with Visual Studio.  Not much else to see here.
